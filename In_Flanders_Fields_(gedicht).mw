In Flanders fields (John McCrae)

:::<i>In Flanders fields the poppies blow 
:::<i>Between the crosses, row on row 
:::<i>That mark our place; and in the sky 
:::<i>The larks, still bravely singing, fly 
:::<i>Scarce heard amid the guns below. 
:::<i>We are the dead. Short days ago 
:::<i>We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow 
:::<i>Loved, and were loved, and now we lie 
:::<i>In Flanders fields. 
:::<i>Take up our quarrel with the foe: 
:::<i>To you from failing hands we throw 
:::<i>The torch; be yours to hold it high. 
:::<i>If ye break faith with us who die 
:::<i>We shall not sleep, though poppies grow 
:::<i>In Flanders fields.
