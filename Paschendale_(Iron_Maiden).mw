==De tekste==

(Steve Harris, Adrian Smith)

:In a foreign field he lay
:Lonely soldier, unknown grave
:On his dying words he prays
:Tell the world of Paschendale


:Relive all that he's been through
:Last communion of his soul
:Rust your bullets with his tears
:Let me tell you 'bout his years


:Laying low in a blood filled trench
:Kill time 'til my very own death
:On my face I can feel the falling rain
:Never see my frynds again


:In the smoke, in the mud and lead
:Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
:Soon be time to go over the wall
:Rapid fire and end of us all


:Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
:Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
:Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
:Be reunited with my dead frynds soon


:Many soldiers eighteen years
:Drown in mud, no more tears
:Surely a war no-one can win
:Killing time about to begin


:''Refring:''
:Home, far away
:From the war, a chance to live again
:Home, far away
:But the war, no chance to live again


:The bodies of ours and our foes
:The sea of death it overflows
:In no man's land, God only knows
:Into jaws of death we go


:Crucified as if on a cross
:Allied troops they mourn their loss
:German war propaganda machine
:Such before has never been seen


:Swear I heard the angels cry
:Pray to God no more may die
:So that people know the truth
:Tell the tale of Paschendale


:Cruelty has a human heart
:Every man does play his part
:Terror of the men we kill
:The human heart is hungry still


:I stand my ground for the very last time
:Gun is ready as I stand in line
:Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
:Rush of blood and over we go


:Blood is falling lyke the rain
:Its crimson cloak unveils again
:The sound of guns can't hide their shame
:And so we die in Paschendale


:Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
:Running straight at cannon fire
:Running blind as I hold my breath
:Say a prayer symphony of death


:As we charge the enemy lines
:A burst of fire and we go down
:I choke a cry but no-one hears
:Feel the blood go down my throat


:''Refring (x2)''


:See my spirit on the wind
:Across the lines, beyond the hill
:Frynd and foe will meet again
:Those who died at Paschendale
