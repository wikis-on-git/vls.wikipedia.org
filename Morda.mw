== Biography ==
 
MORDA hails from Bruges, Belgium (H8000 area) and the band's sound is trademarked by melody, aggression, metal, mosh and pure hardcore. Thanks to an intensive tour/show schedule, MORDA quickly established a big name for themselves within’ the European hardcore scene (and even beyond ea. thanks to their Japan 2006 tour/release). Equipped with a strong and stellar line-up, the band knew it was time to step up with a 100% trustworthy 2007 album. MORDA did what had to be done, hereby delivering a prominent album which will destroy the criticasters in a glimpse. “My Will Supreme” raised the MORDA standard of song writing. Ever since the release of the MORDA “Azerion” album, the band seriously evolved into a hard working monster fronted by the furious new vocalist Gijs Wentein. (lined-up in the summer of 2006). Their 2007 output “My Will Supreme” sounds real, aggressive and pure. One can’t neglect the vocal aggression as it hits amazingly hard. 
 
“My Will Supreme - Interpreted By Many - A World To Indulge”
Most recent release is the “My Will Supreme” album. With 9 songs clocking in over 40 minutes, MORDA proves to know what’s up within the world of heavy music. By all means, “My Will Supreme” delivers. The album is trademarked by aggression, by rage, by power, by fucking heavy breakdowns and by one hell of a melody section (that became the band’s trademark throughout the years, IN FLAMES/AT THE GATES influenced melodies). The lyrical section deals with the everyday-life. MORDA is confident that listeners will be able to relate to the lyrical side of “My Will Supreme”. The album is mastered by Jacob Hansen (HATESPHERE, ABORTED, MAROON,..); recorded by Ace Zec (THE SETUP, DEATH BEFORE DISCO,..). The “My Will Supreme” album is licensed to Reality Records (B). They handle the 12” vinyl press Reality Records is most know for releasing vinyl for bands such as MADBALL, SHELTER, RAMALLAH, THE SETUP, NO TURNING BACK,… Tiranus Records, home based in Brazil, licensed the album for a South American press.
 
"In my will to power life (and its aspects) Azerion was my relief...". 
MORDA's previous release for Eye Spy Records, the "Azerion" album, offers 11 tracks. With the album, MORDA hits hard and uncompromising. We get guest vocals by Marcus HEAVENSHALLBURN and the tracks are all about destructive riffs empowered with lyrics about the daily life and how to deal with that. Reviews all over rave about the "Azerion" album and they categorise MORDA within the league of bands such as old CALIBAN, ARKANGEL, LIAR, HSB, AS I LAY DYING,... and the likes.
 
Next to headline tours throughout Europe and Japan, MORDA was lined up as support act on tours with ALL OUT WAR (2004) and PRO-PAIN (2005 and 2006). With their 6 European tours and the Japan tour, MORDA continuously attacks stages all over.
